      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p id="p1">
        <img src="images/freshmen.png" id="freshmen" alt="freshmen photo">
        My name is <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/2-qiym" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aidan Bai</a>. I was born in Ottawa, <span class="highlight">Canada</span>, and moved to San Diego when I was three years old. I have a brother named Ryan who’s two years older than me. Both my parents are software engineers and I will likely go to some math or computer science related career when I grow up. I am Chinese, and most of my family are in China, hence I go to China every few years to visit them. I am fluent in Chinese and English, although my Chinese skills are on the decline due to lack of usage.

      <h3>My interests</h3>

        <img src="images/oilers.png" id="cow" alt="cow">
        When I was still pretty young, possibly due to the <span class="highlight">Candian</span> influence I was under, I started playing hockey, and I still play to this day. I enjoy the sport for its competitiveness, physicality, and its speed. Currently, I play at the high school varsity level for <a href="https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/984109/aidan-bai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Jolla Country Day</a>. I also participate in math and programming competitions, and spend a decent amount of my time preparing for these. When I’m locked out, (which is always), some of my go to activities to pass time are chess, clash royale on other people’s phones (I don’t have it on my phone), and youtube.

      <h3>Typical day</h3>

        As a high school student attending Canyon Crest Academy, a typical day in my current life involves me waking up at 7:50AM, eating breakfast, and rushing to school. After school I sometimes have <a href="https://cca-pps.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Programming Club</a>, sometimes Math club, and other times have <span class="highlight">hockey</span>, often getting home at 7PM due to these activities. Then, I usually take a nap because I’m tired from the day and also because I have a bad sleep schedule. Due to the (in my opinion completely unnecessary) onslaught of physics homework, I often spend up to an hour getting that finished; sometimes there’s also homework from other classes, which I have to spend even more time doing. After finishing homework, I often spend copious amounts of time surfing the web doing activities one does not need to worry about. I sleep on average at around 1:30AM.
